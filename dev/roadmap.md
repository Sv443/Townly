# Roadmap:
These are extra features I'd like to implement at some point, that aren't vital to having a functional game:  
  
| Feature | Long Description / Requirements | Current Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugins | Dynamically load user created plugins / mods that add cells, special buildings, can listen for events and much more | 🔶 Todo |
| Steam Integration | Put the game on Steam and maybe add some cool features like cloud saves and achievements | 🔶 Todo |
| Discord RPC Integration | Discord rich presence to display the game under the username in Discord | ✅ Done |

<br><br>

### Stages:
- ✅ Done
- 🔶 Todo
- ⚠️ Todo & high priority
- 🔨 WIP
- 🛑 Won't do
