TODO:
Add class ControllerWorker, it will be a separate thread containing the entire game
Main thread is only for the dev menu, it can send signals to the ControllerWorker, telling it what to do






CURRENT GOALS:
1.  Have a grid (no chunks) and have it be filled with empty cells (no map generation)
2.  Display this grid
3.  Implement a cursor that can be moved
4.  Add chunks to the grid
5.  Add some ambient music to the game
6.  Add map generation (based on layered coherent noise) to the grid
7.  Add a main menu (something basic to begin with)
8.  Implement the legacy edition's smoothing algorithm based on cellular automata
9.  Add an in-game currency system, contained in some kind of controller class
10. Create an extendable GUI around a game view (game view contains the grid)
11. Add the legacy edition's components that are derived from the base cell class (Constructable, InhabitedCell, ...)
12. Add water and electricity (need generating buildings), they are distributed globally (don't need pipes and wires yet)
13. Register constructables at startup and make them be able to be built in-game, using up money in the process
14. Add the needs system, paving the way for the leveling-up-system
15. Add the leveling-up-system, only allowing cells to upgrade when their needs are fulfilled
16. Implement MultiCellStructures that consist of more than one cell, increasing size, importance and "texture" resolution
    - With the chunks system this might get complex and will definitely be a pain in the ass to implement correctly

Beta:
17. TBD

(these goals might get changed later on)
