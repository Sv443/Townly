## Reporting a Vulnerability:
To report a vulnerability or security issue, please directly contact me via [Email](mailto:contact@sv443.net) or [joining my Discord server](https://sv443.net/discord) and messaging me privately.  
Please **do not** create a GitHub issue!

## Supported Versions:
Only the latest minor version is supported and will be receiving security updates  
For example, if the current version is v1.12.5, all versions from v1.12.0 up to v1.12.5 will receive security updates  
In case a security vulnerability was found and is patched, a new patch will be released. In the above example that would be v1.12.6
