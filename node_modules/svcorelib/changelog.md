## 1.8.0
- new features:
    - function "jsl.seededRNG.generateSeededNumbers(count, seed)" to generate "random" numbers based on a passed seed
    - function "jsl.seededRNG.generateRandomSeed(digitCount)" to generate a random seed to be used in "jsl.generateSeededNumbers()"

    - function "jsl.randomizeArray(array: array)" to randomize the indexes of the items of an array
    - object "colors" to make it easier to add colors to the console output - this will replace "jsl.consoleColor()"

        - "addMenu()" to add a new menu to the prompt
        - "validateMenu()" to check whether a menu is invalid
        - "currentMenu()" to get the current menu index

    - improved the background stuff in "jsl.ping()" to improve performance
    - added "contentType" property to "jsl.ping()"'s promise callback
    - edited a bunch of functions and methods to throw an error instead of returning it as a string, which could've caused unwanted and unpredictable behavior
    - put the UUID generation inside an object, renamed it and added four new ones:
        - "generateUUID.hexadecimal(format: str, upperCase: bool)" [0-9,a-f/A-F]

<br><br>
