## Townly
### CLI City Building game inspired by TheoTown and Cities:Skylines
I challenged myself multiple times to create games in the Command Line Interface.  
The goal was for me to be able to play the games on my server via SSH.  
You can find my other CLI games [here.](https://github.com/Sv443/CLI-Games-Collection)  
  
Townly was first made in Node.js because I couldn't get my Qt Creator to work on my PC for a whole year ([here's the previous edition's code](https://github.com/Sv443/Townly/tree/legacy/Townly.js)).  
After 2 months of work I started rewriting it in C++ (with Qt) on December 10th.  
The thought behind the rewrite was native compilation to executables, more stability and performance and lower-level access to the system.
