# Teng
This is the engine I am writing alongside the Townly game.  
It is written in TypeScript and was created for CLI (command line / TTY) games.  
  
I currently reserve the rights to the engine.  
It will be released under the MIT license as soon as I deem it's finished enough.  
So currently it is under a very restrictive license, meaning you are **not allowed to distribute it in any way and you are not allowed to include it in your project.**  
You can view the full license text [in this file.](./LICENSE.txt)

<br>

### Goals:
- This engine, once at a stable state, should be available to the public, just like [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal.](https://www.unrealengine.com/)  
  Private / indie dev use should be free (below a certain produced income).  
  Anything above that or outright commercial use should require a paid license to finance development of the engine.
  
- The engine should be completely detachable from the Townly game.  
  Meaning the engine should not depend on anything inside the Townly game files.  
  The other way around, however, is allowed.

### Teng's brand identity:
- The name originates from a combination "Townly" and "Engine", Townly being the game which it was originally developed for.
  
- The logo of the engine should be in ASCII, inspired by its text based nature.  
  An example logo can be found by viewing this file in a text editor (or clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sv443/Townly/master/engine/README.md)) and then scrolling to the bottom.  
  The logo could be inspired by the [flying dragon Teng in Chinese mythology.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teng_(mythology))
